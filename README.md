# p3-starter-code-ggroode - ReadMe

## Dependencies and Instalation Notes
To use certain features (specifically uploading new images) the person running the server will need to have ImageMagick and Potrace installed (both are unix packages).
And of course django and sqlite3 are required.

## Usage note
This website uses djangos database system so if you desire to make any changes to the database the admin account is admin password: admin. This is primarily useful if you want to 
delete an image or palette off of the server, as creation can be handled in the app itself. 

## Update
Making a change to this readme (and nothing else) on 7/19 because I realized I never specified a screen size. App intended for an iPad view as found in the device manager for google chrome (768 x 1024).
